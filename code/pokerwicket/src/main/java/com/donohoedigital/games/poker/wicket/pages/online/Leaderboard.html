            * <strong>DD Poker AI (best)</strong> calculates the DDR1 score based on the best finish of an AI in a game
            (many games have multiple AI, so this uses only the highest finish). <strong>DD Poker AI (rest)</strong>
            calculates the DDR1 score based on all AI finishes except the top AI placement. The "best"
            calculation gives a better sense for how well the DD Poker AI plays (otherwise it is weighed down
            by the other AI in the same tournament since they are all considered the same. As an example,
            if you were allowed to place twice in the same tournament and finished 1st and last, your DDR1
            score would be the average of the two instead of the higher of the two).

    <wicket:fragment wicket:id="ddr1Description">
        This table lists players sorted by the DD Poker Rank 1 Algorithm (DDR1).
        For each tournament you play in, you are awarded points using the
        formula demonstrated in this <a href="https://static.ddpoker.com/DDPokerDDR1.xls">spreadsheet</a>.
        <br/><br/>
        The DDR1 algorithm rewards you for finishing higher than other players
        and appropriately scales based on the number of opponents. The buy-in and prizes paid are
        ignored since they are somewhat arbitrary in the free-money world of DD Poker. Games with
        AI players are awarded slightly fewer points as the AI is a bit easier to beat, but that will
        change as we continually improve its play. The average of your DDR1 for each finish is used
        to calculate your ranking in this table.
    </wicket:fragment>

    <wicket:fragment wicket:id="roiDescription">
        This table lists players sorted by the return on investment (ROI) generated in public
        online DD Poker tournaments. The ROI is based on the total money spent (buy-ins + rebuys + addons)
        and the total prize money won in those tournaments.
        <br/><br/>
        An ROI is an interesting way to do rankings (rather than gross dollars earned) because it
        is impacted less by the size of the buy-in and rebuys (online play with DD Poker is not for
        real money so the actual buy-in amounts are arbitrary). One issue with this ranking is that
        it doesn't effectively average wins in big money tournaments versus low money tournaments.
        The DDR1 ranking is intended to handle that.
