        DD Poker Terms of Use
    </div>
    <div class="description">
        Use of the DD Poker online game service is free, but subject to some reasonable requests.
        Because you will potentially be playing with people you don't know, we ask for a certain level of courtesy
        and respect. We require that you:<br/>
        <br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not use profanity or inappropriate language in the chat room or as part of your online profile
                name.
            </li>
            <li>Do not insult, berate or act in a manner considered disrespectful or rude to other players. In short, be
                nice and friendly in your communications or don't say anything at all.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        If you do not abide by these terms, we reserve the right to deactivate your online profile and to prevent future
        use of this service.<br/>
        <br/>
        We thank you for your cooperation and help in keeping the DD Poker Online Games Portal a fun experience.<br/>
        <br/>
        We reserve the right to change the terms of service at any time.
