<p>A firewall prevents unauthorized communication with your computer. A firewall can be a hardware firewall such as
    a home router.
    See <a href="#routers">Router Setup</a> for information on configuring your router.</p>

<p>Or a firewall can be a software firewall such as Norton Internet Security. In addition to
    firewalls, Internet Security programs can also have application control, to prevent
    unauthorized use of an application. The purpose of security software is to prevent
    communication and disable applications. </p>

<div class="title-banner">Understanding Firewalls, Ports and Routers</div>

<p>In order to host an online game, other computers on the Internet need to know how to
    reach you. When you start (host) an online game, you will supply a <span class="bold">Game URL</span>
    to the others wishing to join your game. This game URL is a single line that consists of an
    IP address, a port number, game ID, and game password. </p>

<p>An IP address stands for Internet Protocol address. Every computer on the Internet is assigned
    one, typically by your Internet service provider; you can think of it like the address on your
    house. If you don't have a router or firewall, the process of hosting a game is pretty
    straightforward. You simply provide your figurative house address, the entire game URL
    shown on your <span class="bold">Setup Online Tournament</span> menu, to the others wishing to join your game for a
    private
    game. You can copy this Game URL with the copy button to the right of the game URL, and paste it into an email to
    invite the other players wishing to join the game. Alternatively, you may paste the game URL into an instant message
    or simply verbally read the number to someone via telephone. If you wish to host or join a public game posted on the
    public games list, an additional step is needed to configure your profile to list/join public games. If you do not
    wish to host or join a game posted as a public game, this step is not needed for private games between friends. </p>

<p> If you have a firewall, a step may be needed in order to host any online game over the
    Internet. A firewall separates your computer from the outside world to prevent hackers
    from being able to access your computer, think of it as a figurative brick wall between
    your computer and the Internet. In order for the outside world to access your computer to
    do things such as receiving email or downloading things from the Internet, <span class="bold">ports</span>
    are used. A port can be thought of as removing a brick from your brick wall to allow incoming
    information to pass through. Specific ports are pre-reserved for things like the Internet and
    email. Online games must use their own port, removing their own brick from the wall in order
    to host online games. DD Poker uses port number 11885.</p>

<p>If you are using an internet security or firewall program, you will need to allow
    &quot;ddpoker&quot; access to the internet, or configure ddpoker access through port 11885.
    Although your setup and version may differ, here are some guidelines for some specific programs.
    Windows SP2 Firewall needs to Unblock the program ddpoker. Norton Internet Security needs to
    add a modify rule to permit TCP and UDP over remote port 11885. If using the Mac firewall, add
    a new incoming network communication to allow DD Poker on port 11885. If using the Zone Alarm,
    allow all internet and server access to ddpoker.exe. </p>

<p>If you have a router, you will need to &quot;port forward&quot; or set up a &quot;virtual
    server&quot;. A router allows several computers in your home to share your connection to
    the Internet, it also supports its own built-in firewall.&nbsp; Your router keeps the IP
    address assigned by your Internet service provider as its own. The router then assigns local
    IP addresses to each computer in your home or LAN (local area network). This internal IP
    address can not be seen by the outside world. So in order for the computer hosting your poker
    game to receive incoming game information from the Internet, your router uses <span class="bold">Port
        Forwarding</span>.&nbsp; This allows game information sent to your router from the other
    player's computer to communicate with the computer hosting the game behind your router. The
    router must be setup to do this, by being told to forward anything entering either TCP or UDP
    ports 11885 to 11889 to the local IP address of the computer that is hosting the poker game.</p>

<p>Some DSL modems have their own built in firewalls. So someone could potentially have three
    firewalls, their DSL modem, router, and software firewall. If the <span class="bold">Test Connection</span>
    button test failed, a firewall in any of these three areas can be blocking incoming connections,
    and require the ports to be opened. Note: You may still Join online games without setting up
    any ports, you only need to configure your ports if you wish to Host an online game. </p>

                game
                identification number and game password tacked on. The entire URL needs to be used in order to host or
                join
                games. You may notice when hosting, there are two different types of URL's, one generated by your local
                area
                network, and one for the internet. If your computer is connected directly to the internet, these numbers
                will be the same. It uses the IP address of your computer, most likely assigned by your internet service
                provider. In the case of a home router, your LAN URL and internet URL will be slightly different, the IP

                URL

                IP
                address assigned by your router and can only be used by computers in your local area network. This is
                good

<div class="title-banner">Online Stability and Disconnections</div>

<p>Disconnections and the stability of an online game is dependant on many things. Some are within your control to
    improve and others are not. &nbsp;For those familiar with live action online gaming such as first person shooter
    games, you will sometimes notice jumps in the action and the game will even pause occasionally to get all the
    players back in sync. Although it can be irritating to skip to a new position due to a jump in action, the game will
    continue. Good article <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/connect/Article-LagFreeGame-pg1.htm">here</a> from
    XBOX on lag-free games. A poker game does not need to communicate vast amounts of data such as the movement in a
    first person shooter, but the data it does communicate is critical that it is not lost. If someone has a brief
    disconnection, we can not simply assume they wanted to fold and not raise, the action must wait until the person
    reconnects. By taking some preventative measures, you can reduce the number of disconnections that occur in a game.
    Shown below are tips on Hosting, Adware, and Line Quality. </p>

<p><span class="bold">Hosting -</span> DD Poker uses what is called as a peer to peer hosting method. Our central
    server helps arrange public games, but once the game starts, it is the computer of the person hosting the game that
    communicates to all joined guests. For this reason, it makes sense that the person hosting has a system and internet
    connection that can handle this gracefully, especially if they are hosting a lot of people.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Line quality - </strong>A good internet connection is probably the most important factor in reducing
        disconnections. Although the user can not control all aspects of their internet connection, there are measures
        that can be taken to clean up the signal and reduce disconnections. (see Line Quality below)
    </li>
    <li><strong>Recommended system requirements -</strong> For games with 11-30 guests, we recommend a computer with the
        minimum of a 1 Gig processor and 512 Meg Ram.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Limit multitasking -</strong> Limit the amount of multi-tasking especially web surfing involving large
        file transfers or streaming video.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Adware removal -</strong> Adware can use up valuable processing power and memory causing your computer
        speed to crawl. (see Adware and Spyware below)
    </li>
    <li><strong>Reboot </strong>- If you are having connection issues, reboot your computer, modem and router before
        hosting to clear the memory and buffers, and stop extra processes running running on your pc.
    </li>
</ul>

<p><span class="bold">Adware and Spyware -</span> Adware and spyware are typically commercial
    programs installed on your computer without your knowledge, and feed various things like pages visited and even
    personal information to their clients. Then can use this information for things like pop up ads that are marketed
    specifically to you. Unless you already actively run anti-adware and anti-spyware software, your computer is most
    likely infected without your knowledge. Adware and spyware is commercial and not intended to destroy data as in some
    viruses, but they will use up valuable processing power and memory. Although a few of these running on your computer
    will not have much effect, once infected they can multiply where you could easily have dozens on your computer
    running hundreds of processes to the point that your computer moves at a snails pace. We trust and recommend a free
    reveal program called <a href="http://www.lavasoftusa.com/software/adaware/">Ad-Aware SE Personal from Lavasoft</a>.
    <br>
</p>

<p><span class="bold">Line Quality - </span>Line quality and the stability of an online game is
    dependant on several factors. The path your ISP takes to the host, server capacity, Internet traffic, your hardware,
    processing ability due to adware, cable congestion in your neighborhood, or your wiring.</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="bold">Broadband Tests  - </span> <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/tools">Broadband Reports</a>
        is a great resource for information on improving your internet connection. They also provide users with free
        tests to check their line speed and line quality. This is a good starting point to check out your internet
        connection.<br>

        the host of a game. Displays latency and packet loss.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li><span class="bold">Wireless -</span> Your wireless connection to the internet can be compromised depending on
        the path your wireless signal, and even some wireless router brands are known to cause occasional disconnects.
        If your computer is connected to the internet via a wireless device such as a wireless router, see if your
        connectivity improves by placing the computer within 5-10 feet of the wireless device. For an analogy, you
        sometimes have trouble hearing people with a cordless phone when you are around walls or a long distance away,
        although your wireless router has improved technology with things such as frequency hopping, don't think your
        wireless router is immune to interference. Avoid obstacles between the wireless router and computer such as
        large metal cabinets or appliances. Avoid interference such as cordless telephones or bluetooth devices in near
        proximity to the wireless router or computer. Make sure your wireless device antenna is pointed vertically.
        Interference can also be caused by things such as microwave ovens and amateur radio too.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li><span class="bold">Router -</span> It is possible that your router can cause your internet connection to
        performing sluggishly, freeze unexpectedly or experience dropped connections. Every router contains its own
        built in software that handles the network communication. This built in software is called firmware. Since your
        router was manufactured, there are most likely firmware revisions released that improve your router's ability to
        communicate with other network devices. Even a new router can contain firmware which is already several months
        old before the router is sold. We advise you check your router manufacturer's web site to see if there are any
        firmware updates for your router that addresses connectivity issues. Follow your router manufacture's
        instructions to do this update. If you are still experiencing connectivity issues after updating your router
        firmware, you may want to check to see if newer software is available for your network adapter, your network
        adapter software is known as a &quot;driver&quot;. Updating your drivers is a bit more involved and we do not
        recommend it without consulting a tech support engineer or contacting your PC manufacturer/network adapter
        manufacturer for further assistance.

</ul>
<ul>
    <li><span class="bold">Cable -</span> Your physical cable wiring and your cable provider's internet congestion
        can cause issues with cable broadband.
        <blockquote style="padding-left: 20px; padding-top:10px;">
            <p><span class="bold">Wiring -</span> Original cable TV wiring was designed using RG-59 cable. A higher
                quality RG-6
                cable, will promote less loss and higher speeds. Cables should be replaced if a visual inspection of the
                screw on connectors at the ends of the cable shows signs of loose connectors or especially frayed metal
                shielding. This frayed metal shielding acts as an antenna causing interference which leeds to packet
                loss and ultimately reduction in speed and game disconnections. Check with your broadband provider, they
                may have a web interface that shows your signal to noise ratio. A low signal to noise ratio can cause
                packet loss, re transmissions and slow speeds. From the point that your cable enters the house to every
                TV, cable box, and modem, confirm there are not extra wires not connected to anything or splitters used
                with an open terminal. This can cause an impedance mismatch leading to signal reflection and a low
                signal to noise ratio. If your inside wiring looks good but your signal to noise ratio is low, your
                cable from your house to the pole may be the culprit. Any exposed wire even caused from a squirrels
                chewing on the cable can cause interference. If you have ever noticed a shadow watching a broadcast
                station over cable such as channel 3, 5 or 8 is an indicator of this. <br>
            </p>

            <p><span class="bold">Congestion -</span> Cable has an advantage over DSL because it can offer higher
                download
                speeds. But cable's disadvantage is the narrow upstream bandwidth causing congestion during peak hours.
                One of the most common complaints for cable modems is that of increased latency
                and other problems as more subscribers in a given area come on line since cable users in the same
                area share bandwidth. Cable companies are using a very narrow band for return signaling, otherwise
                know as the upstream or return path. This is positioned below all the space allocated for TV
                channels. This band is prone to RF interference and is very limited in capacity. Upstream
                transmissions may therefore compete with others in the area, get delayed (suffer high latency)
                due to noise fighting techniques, and cable TOS (Terms Of Service) typically prohibit any kind
                of constant upstream use. Internet use is shifting away from central servers broadcasting to
                many individuals and some interesting peer to peer applications like online gaming. These
                applications need a strong upstream channel. <a

    <li><span class="bold">DSL -</span> Original phone wiring used for DSL lines can be a source for line noise
        causing packet loss and a reduction in speed. The cheapest and easiest way for a DSL provider to get broadband
        into your home is to use existing phone wiring with line sharing. This potentially can cause problems in two
        areas, your wiring and filtering.<br><br>

        <p class="style13">A common misconception among computer users is that the telephone company and long-distance
            switching network is a &quot;perfect system.&quot; The advent of error-correcting, high-speed modems which
            mask
            line-noise and push the data transfer tolerance window to the limit, has given us a false sense of belief
            that
            everything should work at top speed every time. Not so! There is that age old problem known as LINE NOISE.
            Line
            noise may or may not be apparent to your &quot;naked ear&quot;, however your modem can and will react to
            this
            annoying phenomenon. Some complaints which can be attributed to line noise are: &quot;The system was very
            slow
            in responding tonight.&quot; <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/faq/1703">From Broadband Reports FAQ</a></p>

        <blockquote style="padding-left: 20px; padding-top:10px;">
            <p><span class="bold">Wiring -</span> Unless you have a modern home, most home phone wiring was designed for
                analog voice
                not high speed digital. Also, since home owners are now responsible for their own wiring, many homes
                have
                all kinds of crazy wiring jobs. Every phone jack in the house should be checked to make sure there is no
                corrosion, shorts with other wires, loose wires or loose splitter connections. Avoid running your modem
                phone wire in parallel with power cables. Some people like to wrap all their cords together to be tidy,
                but
                it would be better to run your power wires separated from your data cables. Also, check for the same if
                there is a common terminal in the basement where all your phones are connect to. One method of
                troubleshooting is to disconnect all your other phone wires from the source and test your DSL. You may
                even
                want to test your modem wired directly to the gray NID, &quot;network interface device&quot; outside.
                This
                is either gray or black phone box on the outside of your home.<br>
                <br>
                The best way to reduce packet loss and increase speed is to run a new good quality line from your NID
                phone
                box to your modem. You will need an NID splitter/filter to split your phone line at the box. The
                splitter
                sends one line to your dedicated DSL modem, and the other filters all your original phone wiring at
                once(see
                filtering below). You can also pay to have your DSL provider or phone company put this whole house NID
                splitter/filter in your NID box and run a dedicated DSL line to your modem. If you find you still have
                trouble connected directly to your NID, the problem may be in your line from your house to the pole or
                beyond to the &quot;CO&quot; where your DSL provider connects you to the internet. In these cases it is
                the
                phone companies problem. You should have your equipment or telephone line checked. You can call your
                phone
                company and ask them to have your line checked for noise on your telephone line. If their test does not
                meet
                the FCC requirement for line noise, they will come out and fix the issue even potentially replace the
                phone
                line from your house to the pole.<br>
            </p>

            <p><span class="bold">Filtering -</span> DSL line share wiring requires your phones to be filtered.
                Filtering prevents
                any interference from phones, cable boxes, satellite boxes, and fax machines. You have two choices to do
                this filtering. You can install a filter on each phone and phone device or filter your entire home. The
                DSL
                company prefers to filter each phone individually because they do not need to send a technician to your
                home, it is easier to simply send you an installation kit with enough filters for all your phones. This
                is
                not the best way since you have all the phone wires and devices in your house acting to add potential
                interference and packet loss, due to line noise and reflection due to impedance mismatch. Or the best
                method
                is to filter all your phones at once with a whole house filter, otherwise known as an NID
                splitter/filter,
                and run a dedicated line from your NID box to your modem. This is the best way to achieve the fastest
                speeds
                with the best quality.</p>

    <li><span class="bold">Dial up -</span> You can easily connect to an online game using a dial up modem. But we
        recommend that you do not use your bandwidth by surfing or downloading files at the same time. You are also
        capable of hosting, although it would be better to join as a guest to someone else's hosted game using
        broadband. Follow the same wiring suggestions described in the DSL section to improve your speed and reduce
        disconnections. <br>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><p><span class="bold">Latency and Bandwidth -</span> Latency and Bandwidth are related.&nbsp; Latency(speed)
        measures delays between each transmission and is measured with network tools like ping and trace-route.&nbsp;Bandwidth
        refers to how much data can be transferred in a given amount of time and is often measured by timing how long it
        takes to transmit a large file. Network latency delays may be due to signals passing through various routers and
        proxies, or it may be due to distance, such as the propagation delays of satellite transmissions.&nbsp;
        Applications that use voice conferencing are more sensitive to latency than to bandwidth, and you can hear the
        delays when talking over a satellite or voice-over-IP network. If you have packet loss due to poor line quality,
        packets may need to be resent and cause more latency.</p>

        <p>You may verify your latency by doing a ping to determine your latency for the first hop to your internet
            gateway.
            Latency measured in milliseconds can be checked with a ping utility. A small packet of data is sent to a
            host
            and the round-trip time, time it takes for the packet to leave the source host, travel to the destination
            host
            and return back to the source host is measured in milliseconds. This figure is a snapshot in time and may
            change
            based on network traffic or other conditions even such as weather such as rainy days and ice storms can
            affect
            latency. Ideally, the measured time should be as low as possible. High latencies, despite your fast line,
            may
            indicate extensive hidden (tunneled) routing between you, and your internet gateway.</p>

        <p>Bandwidth is normally expressed in bits per second. It's the amount of data that can be transferred during a
            second. Solving bandwidth is easier than solving latency. To solve bandwidth, more pipes are added.
            Bandwidth
            and latency are connected. If the bandwidth is saturated then congestion occurs and latency is increased.
            However, if the bandwidth of a circuit is not at peak, the latency will not decrease. Bandwidth can always
            be
            increased but latency cannot be decreased. Latency is the function of the electrical characteristics of the
            circuit.</p>

<div class="title-banner">Disconnections Out Of Your Control</div>


<p>
    If you have done everything mentioned above in <a href="#disconnections">Online Stability and Disconnects</a> for
    what is in your control at home, the problem may simply be an ISP issue out of your control.<br>
</p>

<p>Even switching ISP's is not guarantee to improve your internet connection. Typically since all DSL companies share
    space at your local telephone company, the &quot;CO&quot; central office, if the issues are there the problems will
    not go away. Switching from DSL to cable or vise/versa may solve some problems but create others.</p>

<p>The perfect internet world would act more like a LAN and there would be no delay of packets causing latency and no
    lost packets. Hosts with very good home connection with a very good service provider on a low congestion day can
    have zero problems. </p>

<p>On the other extreme is a host with a poor home connection to start with, on a day with an ice storm in a part of the
    country where some of their packets are being sent through, on a Saturday night when the internet is at it's peak.
    Now you have a situation where packets are being lost, and ones that do arrive are sometimes delayed due to
    resending packets and latency due to congestion.</p>

<p>If the host computer does not receive an alive signal from the guest, you may notice a &quot;Disconnected&quot;
    placard appear over their cards. TCP, the protocol used by DD, must verify a packet is sent before the next arrives
    in order. Depending on the severity of the delay and packet losses, you may notice the placard constantly turning on
    and off or even turn on for a several seconds. If the packet loss is severe enough, TCP completely stops sending
    lost packets as TCP test packets are sent out until a connection is re-established. This can explain why some people
    have trouble re-connecting all together.</p>

<p>People that play Xbox live games will also notice this on high congestion days or when ISP's are having trouble due
    to weather or other. An example, players may notice their character in a first person shooter game jump or notice
    other players jump to a new location to re-sync due to packet loss and latency. These types of game address this
    problem by simply re-syncing the game. If the problem gets bad enough or the host quits, you will notice the game go
    to a blue screen and allow everyone to re-sync or a new host is chosen. </p>

<p>In a poker game, if it is your turn to act, you can not simply jump that person ahead and assume they have called. We
    must wait until we have positive confirmation of their action. If some guests are having internet issues, the game
    will still flow nicely, everyone will simply notice those players having trouble with disconnection placards. If the
    host or host's ISP , or regional hub where the hosts packets are being transferred is having trouble, you may notice
    large numbers of disconnects. </p>

<p>Hopefully this offers some insight into internet packet loss and latency.</p>
