    <div class="title"><strong>About DD Poker 3</strong></div>

    <div class="description">Donohoe Digital released DD Poker 1 in June 2004. It
        was one of the very first poker software products on the
        market and was pretty popular. DD Poker 2 arrived in Fall 2005 with major new features
        such as online play and a sophisticated odds calculator. Improvements were made consistently over a dozen point
        releases culminating with the release of DD Poker 2.5 in Summer 2006. A major upgrade to the
        Online Game Portal was released in Spring 2008. DD Poker 3.0 was released as donation-ware
        in January 2009. It continued to be updated sporadically until it was
        shutdown in July 2017.  DD Poker was revived as open source software in August 2024.

            <p>DD Poker offers the best way to play poker with friends and family
                on your local area network (LAN) or over the Internet. Using a
                peer-2-peer architecture, DD Poker does not depend on a central
                server. Because you can play on the LAN behind a firewall, it
                is ideal for playing at work (on your lunch break, of course).
                DD Poker is like having your very own online poker, without the
                rake!</p>

            <p>DD Poker tracks every hand of poker you play, whether online
                or during practice. Use the DD Poker statistics to identify the
                hands you play well or poorly.</p>

            <p>Use the Calculator Tool to calculate showdown odds, evaluate
                the strength of your hand, determine your outs and figure out
                where you stand compared to your opponents.</p>

            <p>Run a tournament during your weekly poker night! Define the tournament
                structure including buys-ins, rebuy, add-ons and prizes. The built-in
                poker clock is just like those used in major tournaments. The
                clock is helpful because it lets you know when it is time to raise
                the blinds or end re-buys.</p>
