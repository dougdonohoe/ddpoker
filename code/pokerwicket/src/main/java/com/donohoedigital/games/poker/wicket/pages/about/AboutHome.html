    <div class="title"><strong>About DD Poker 3</strong></div>

    <div class="description">Donohoe Digital released DD Poker 1 in June 2004. It
        was one of the very first poker software products on the
        market and was pretty popular. DD Poker 2 arrived in Fall 2005 with major new features
        such as online play and a sophisticated odds calculator. Improvements were made consistently over a dozen point
        releases culminating with the release of DD Poker 2.5 in Summer 2006. A major upgrade to the
        <wicket:link><a href="../online/OnlineHome.html">Online
            Game Portal</a></wicket:link>
        was released in Spring 2008. Now, the team is at it again with the release of
        DD Poker 3 as a <span class="mild">Free</span> product (more trouble for the <a href="about/competition">so-called
            "competition"</a>).

                        against computer opponents that are modeled after real types of
                        playing styles such as Fish, Rock, Weak-Tight and Solid. Customize

                    <p>Choose from 15 pre-defined tournament formats like the World
                        Championship or design your own, specifying antes, blinds, buy-in,

                    <p>DD Poker offers the best way to play poker with friends and family
                        on your local area network (LAN) or over the Internet. Using a
                        peer-2-peer architecture, DD Poker does not depend on a central
                        server. Because you can play on the LAN behind a firewall, it
                        is ideal for playing at work (on your lunch break, of course).
                        DD Poker is like having your very own online poker, without the
                        rake!</p>
