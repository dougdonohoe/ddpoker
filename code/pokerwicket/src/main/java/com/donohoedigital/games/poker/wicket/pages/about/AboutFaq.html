    <div class="faq">
        <div class="faq-question">Q1.
            Why is DD Poker Free?
        </div>

        <p>We answer this on our <a href="donate">Donate</a> page.</p>

        <div class="faq-question">Q2.
            Does DD Poker support LAN/Internet play?
        </div>

        <p>
            Yes, DD Poker has supported LAN/Internet play since version 2.0.</p>

        <div class="faq-question">Q3.
            What platforms does the game run on?
        </div>

        <p>
            Windows (98/2000/Me/XP/Vista), Mac OS X (10.4.5 and higher) and Linux (x86).</p>


        <div class="faq-question">Q4.
            Is the game written in Java?
        </div>

        <p>
            Yes, we use Java 1.5 (aka Java 5) as the primary platform for the game.
        </p>

        <div class="faq-question">Q5.
            Is the game distributed as a standalone executable or does it
            require an external Java VM (virtual machine) to run?
        </div>

        <p>
            On the PC and Linux, the game is distributed as a standalone,
            complete executable and will not require an external VM.&nbsp;
            It is installed with a typical installer and launched from the
            Start menu or desktop. The normal game player will not be aware
            or need to know about the use of Java or a particular JVM.</p>

        <p>On
            the Mac, the game is installed using a typical installer and
            launched from the Applications folder like any other Mac application. You must
            have Java 5 installed. You probably already have this as it is pre-installed in
            the latest version of Mac OS X or is available through software update.</p>

        <div class="faq-question">Q6.

<div class="description">


<div class="faq">

<div class="faq-question">Q1. How do you play Texas Hold'em?</div>
<p>Texas Hold'em is a game of poker, some call it THE game; the Cadillac of poker.&nbsp; No-limit
    Texas Hold'em is the game played at the World Series of Poker to determine the best poker player
    the land.&nbsp; The actual play is where each player receives two cards face-down and then combines
    them with five community (face-up) cards to make the best possible five-card hand. &nbsp;A very
    simple game that takes a lifetime to master.</p>

<p>Texas Hold'em gets the betting started by forcing bets before the hole cards are dealt.&nbsp;
    These are called 'blinds'.&nbsp; There are two blinds; the Small Blind and the Big Blind.&nbsp;
    The two players immediately to the left of the dealer make the blind bets before they receive
    their hole cards.&nbsp; Thus a 'blind' bet.&nbsp; Two cards are then dealt face down to each player;
    these are called the 'hole cards'.&nbsp; Play proceeds clockwise from the blinds. &nbsp;Each player
    then chooses to call the Big Blind, raise, or fold.&nbsp; The player placing the Big Blind may raise,
    check the bet, or fold.</p>

<p>Three cards are then dealt face up on the table; this is called the 'Flop'.&nbsp; A round of betting
    takes place, with the action starting to the dealer's immediate left; players again choose to check,
    bet, raise, or fold.&nbsp; Another card is dealt face up; this is called the 'Turn' or '4th street'.&nbsp;
    Another round of betting takes place.&nbsp; The fifth and final card, called the 'River' or '5th
    Street', is dealt face up and followed by the final round of betting.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The remaining players make the best five-card hand possible using any of their two cards and the
    five community cards.&nbsp; The winner is either the player with the best hand or the player
    that is left after having every other player fold.</p>

<div class="faq-question">Q2. What is No Limit Hold'em?</div>
<p>'No limit' means that there is <strong>no limit to the
    amount a player may bet</strong> in any given round; up to the amount
    the player has in his stack. A player can choose to go 'All
    In' and bet everything they have forcing the other players
    to either match a very large bet or to fold. </p>

<div class="faq-question">Q3. What are the Flop, Turn and
    River?
</div>
<p>The Flop refers to the first three community cards dealt in a game of hold'em. The fourth
    community card is called The Turn or <strong>4th Street</strong>. The fifth community card is
    called The River or 5th Street. &nbsp;<em>I'm ahead with a straight when he sucks out a flush
        on the Turn; I got drowned on the River.</em></p>

<div class="faq-question">Q4. What are the Small Blind
    and Big Blind?
</div>
<p><strong>A blind bet is a mandatory forced bet</strong> before any cards are dealt.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The Small Blind is the first bet placed by the player immediately to the left of the dealer.&nbsp;
    It is generally half the Big Blind. Example: Small Blind = $2.00 then the Big Blind = $4.00.</p>

<p>The Big Blind is the next bet, placed by the player immediately to the left of the Small Blind.
    Example: Small Blind = $2.00 then the Big Blind = $4.00.</p>

<p>During tournaments the blinds are increased on a regular basis.&nbsp; Example: Blinds are raised
    every 30min.&nbsp; Small Blind increases to $3.00 and the Big Blind increases to $6.00; another
    30min. the blinds increase to $4.00 and $8.00, and so on.&nbsp; This increases the pressure on
    the players and increases the chance of elimination.</p>

<div class="faq-question">Q5. What does it mean to go 'All
    In'?
</div>
<p>A player goes 'All In' when they choose to bet
    all of their chips in a betting round.</p>

<div class="faq-question">Q6. What does it mean to check,
    call, raise, and fold?
</div>
<p><strong>Check</strong>: to pass on betting keeping yourself
    in the hand to call, raise or fold after other players act.<br>
    <strong>Call</strong>: to match a player's bet with even
    money.<br>
    <strong>Raise</strong>: to place a bet larger than a bet already
    placed on the table. A raise must be greater than or equal to
    the bet being called. <br>
    <strong>Fold</strong>: to throw your hand away.</p>

<div class="faq-question">Q7. What is the Button?</div>
<p>The button is a white disc that is passed around the table
    in clockwise order. The button is used in games where there
    is a single or casino dealer. The button identifies the player
    as the 'dealer'. It is still important that play
    continues as if each player is dealing cards. </p>

<p>Cards are dealt beginning with the player to the left of the
    button, and ending with the player who has the button in front
    of him. When the hand is over, the button is moved one spot
    clockwise for the start of the next hand.</p>

<div class="faq-question">Q8. What does
    it mean to 'Limp In'?
</div>
<p>The player calls a bet before the flop trying to see the flop cheaply, or hoping to check-raise
    a player that bets farther around the table.&nbsp; <em>He limped in with a call on the big blind
        and then flopped a full house.</em></p>

<div class="faq-question">Q9. What is 'tight
    play', 'loose play', 'aggressive play' and 'passive play'?
</div>
<p>These are all terms that describe playing styles.&nbsp; Loose and tight generally refer to a player's
    attitude toward his stack of chips.&nbsp; The loose player bets more often prior to the flop and will
    gamble more to try and make a hand. They tend to bluff a lot.</p>

<p>A player that is 'tight' plays few hands that are carefully selected; they'll fold easily.&nbsp; They
    tend to only play strong hands.</p>

<p>Passive and aggressive refer to a player's attitude toward other players. A 'passive' player tends to
    follow other player's leads and not try to command the table while an 'aggressive' player tries to
    command the table and force others to chase him or fold.</p>

<p>These attitudes combine to create four generalized playing styles:</p>

<p><strong>Loose-passive:</strong> These players don't guard every penny, but they do tend to follow
    other players leads. These players will play most hands, but rarely initiate bets or raises.
    Loose-passive play is typified by casual 'poker night' games amongst friends.</p>

<p><strong>Loose-aggressive:</strong> These players are also free with their money, but they are in
    the game for the action and want to command the game. These players will raise often, even with
    weak cards. Loose-aggressive play is typified by the 'play money' internet poker rooms where no
    real money is at stake.</p>

<p><strong>Tight-passive:</strong> These players are careful with their money and follow other player's
    leads. These players let others initiate betting, call when they have good cards and seldom raise.
    Tight-passive play is typified by regulars at public card rooms.</p>

<p><strong>Tight-aggressive:</strong> These players guard their money, but also love the competition
    and want to command the game. They may let other's initiate betting, but when they raise it is
    very probable that they hold good cards. Tight-aggressive play is typified by professional poker
    players and those in tournaments.</p>

<p>It is important to note that none of these play styles is absolute &ndash; anyone may 'push his
    luck' or bluff if they feel the time is right.</p>

<div class="faq-question">Q10. What is 'playing the
    board'?
</div>
<p>A player can choose to 'play the board' and use only community cards.&nbsp; If the best hand is in
    the community cards the pot is split between the players still in the hand.&nbsp; <em>We played
        the board with a full house and split the pot.</em></p>

<div class="faq-question">Q11. What are Overcards?</div>
<p>If you hold a pocket pair (a pair in your face-down cards)
    then overcards are any higher card. For example, you are dealt
    a pair of 5's in your face down cards and the Flop is
    2, 9, Jack. The overcards are 9 and J.</p>

<div class="faq-question">Q12. What is 'Tilt Mode'?</div>
<p>A player in tilt mode is playing reckless because of a recent loss.&nbsp; <em>He lost that last hand
    on the River so now he's on tilt mode trying to win back his money.</em></p>

<div class="faq-question">Q13. What is 'burning a
    card'?
</div>
<p>When dealing the Flop, The Turn, and the River the dealer should
    take the top card off the deck and remove it from play without
    any player seeing it. Burning a card protects against cheating
    or accidentally seeing the cards.</p>

<div class="faq-question">Q14. What is to
    'Come Over The Top'?
</div>
<p>Coming over the top is when you raise or re-raise an opponent's bet. &nbsp;<em>I raised $50.00 but
    then he came over the top with $100.00.</em></p>

<div class="faq-question">Q15. When am I
    'Playing Dead'?
</div>
<p>Playing Dead is a hand where you have no chance of winning while there are still cards to be
    dealt<em>.&nbsp; He flopped into four of a kind so I was playing dead with my two pair.</em></p>

<div class="faq-question">Q16. What's a
    fish?
</div>
<p>A fish is a very loose, often inexperienced player.&nbsp; Fish tend to lose often.&nbsp; Sometimes
    called a live one.<em>&nbsp; If you haven't figured out who the fish is at the table it's
        probably you.</em></p>

<div class="faq-question">Q17. What's a
    rebuy?
</div>
<p>Some tournaments allow players to buy in again if they go broke or if their chip stack falls
    below a certain level.</p>

<div class="faq-question">Q18. What is 'rabbit-hunting'?</div>
<p>A player searches through the undealt cards to see what would have happened had the hand played
    out.&nbsp; This is not allowed in tournament games and many casinos<em>.&nbsp; He folded on the
        flop and then tried to go rabbit-hunting to see the Turn and the River.</em></p>

<div class="faq-question">Q19.
    What is Big Slick?
</div>
<p>Ace-King
    hole cards.</p>

<div class="faq-question">Q20. What is American Airlines?</div>
<p>A pair of Aces.</p>

<div class="faq-question">Q21.
    What is Presto?
</div>
<p>Pocket
    5s.</p>

<div class="faq-question">Q22.
    What are The Nuts?
</div>
<p>In a hold-em hand, the nuts refer to the two hole cards that make the best possible hand. For
    example, if the board shows A Q J 5 4 (different suits), then the nuts are K 10, to make a
    straight; the best possible hand.</p>

<div class="faq-question">Q23.
    What are Gut Shot and Belly Busters?
</div>
<p>This
    refers to a inside straight draw where only only one card will
    complete the straight. For example, if your best hand is 9 8
    6 5, then you are on a Gut Shot (or Belly Buster) draw for a 7.</p>

<div class="faq-question">Q24. What are
    Trips?
</div>
<p>Three of a kind.</p>

<div class="faq-question">Q25. What is the
    Overpair, 2nd Pair, and Bottom Pair?
</div>
<p>If the Flop is Q, 9, 4 then an Overpair would be KK, the second pair would be J9, and the
    bottom pair would be 42.</p>

<div class="faq-question">Q26. What is The
    Deadman's Hand?
</div>
<p>The Deadman's Hand was the hand held by Wild Bill Hickock when he was shot in the back during a
    poker game in Deadwood, SD.&nbsp; It consisted of two pair: black Aces and Eights.&nbsp; The
    fifth card is in dispute.</p>

<div class="faq-question">Q27. What's Union
