    <div class="title"><strong>The "Competition"</strong></div>

    <div class="description">
        <p>To say that there is no true competition to DD Poker
            would be silly and naive. There is plenty of competition for your
            business, gentle reader, and where you spend your free time. We at Donohoe
            Digital believe we have created the very best poker software you can
            find: one that meets or exceeds all your poker needs ... all for a
            very reasonable price ... <span class="mild">Free!</span></p>

        <p><em>Prove it to me</em>, you say! Well, okay. Below
            is some food for thought on the three main alternatives you have to
            DD Poker.</p>

        <div class="title-smaller">Online Poker Rooms</div>
        <p>Online poker rooms are great for playing for real money
            with strangers. However, if you want to play a friendly game with
            friends and family only, you have few options. Not many poker rooms
            offer private tables, and those that do charge a rake.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The DD Poker community is one of the friendliest on
                the Internet. For the past three years, they have organized
                an annual trip to Las Vegas
                in November for an in-person DD Poker tournament.
            </li>
            <li>DD Poker is great for playing online with friends
                and family over your LAN or the internet.
            </li>

            <li>Few poker rooms we are aware of offer the learning tools
                that DD Poker provides.
            </li>

            <li>Use DD Poker to practice and become better so
                you can do better at the online poker rooms.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="title-smaller">3D Poker Entertainment Titles</div>
        <p>The main goal of the poker games with 3D graphics appears
            to be to replicate the feel of real poker. You get to sit at a virtual
            table and see all your opponents. You see the cards get dealt and
            watch as the opponents think about their action. Some will even talk
            to you, although after a few dozen hands, they become quite repetitive
            (after all, it is expensive to have actors do voice over work). You
            have to sit through the hands after you fold a poor hand. Essentially,
            you are playing poker at roughly the speed of a real live game.</p>

        <p>The truth is that playing real, live poker can be quite
            boring. Honestly. Especially if you are playing &quot;correct&quot;
            poker. The poker you see in a one or two hour TV show has been edited
            down from six or eight or more hours of actual poker. And this footage
            is only of the final table, which was arrived at after four or five
            days long days at the poker table. Poker requires a lot of patience
            because you often have long stretches of time in between playable
            hands. Any professional poker player will tell you that it is real
            work, requires a lot of discipline and can sometimes be not so fun.
            Now given that, why would you want to replicate this experience in
            a game?</p>

        <p class="callout">DD Poker lets you play more hands in less time.
            You can jump to the end of a hand after folding. You can configure
            how long it takes the computer players to act. The game moves at your
            speed.</p>

        <p>Another aspect of these 3D fancy graphics poker games
            is that they typically run in full screen mode, taking up the entire
            screen. While this is fine and dandy for practice, it doesn't quite
            fit the bill for online play. You don't see online poker rooms taking
            up the full screen, do you? That's because you typically have some
            down time while in an online game and want to multi-task, checking
            email or surfing the web or doing the work you are supposedly getting
            paid for.</p>

        <p class="callout">DD Poker lets you multi-task, control the size
            of the window, and most importantly, lets you play at work where a
            quick alt-tab brings up that spreadsheet to <span class="spicy">hide the
            game </span> when your boss walks by.</p>

        <div class="title-smaller">So-called Professional Poker Trainers</div>
        <p>If you search hard enough, you will find very expensive
            poker products available for sale over the internet. Some cost $30 or $59
            or even a whopping $85. We do not want to out right name these
            competitors (to avoid embarassing them), but rest assured,
            you would be better off going with
            DD Poker. Read on for more specifics.</p>

        <p>One competitor claims to have the &quot;#1 Rated Software
            For 18 Years Straight&quot;, but they fail to backup this claim with
            actual article dates and citations. We acknowledge they probably had
            the best software out there five years ago, but they haven't kept
            up with the times. The interface is clumsy, outdated and hard to use.
            They don't offer online play or a poker clock. They don't offer in
            game information like pot odds or chance of improvement. There is
            nothing to match the broad array of information about a hand you can
            learn via the DD Poker Calculator Tool.</p>

        <p class="callout">DD Poker has a modern interface and is packed
            with features for <span class="mild">Free</span>!</p>

        <p>Another competitor, the most expensive of the bunch
            at $85, claims 10 years of research behind its poker AI, much of
            which is available on the public internet, so it's not so secret.
            The truth is that this research is focused on playing limit hold'em,
            which is a much easier game to get a grasp on versus no-limit holdem.
            While their research no doubt helps create a decent no-limit player,
            they are missing many aspects of no-limit that simple number crunching
            cannot account for like tilt, boredom and table position. These limitations
            are visible when you consider their advice consists of gems like &quot;Fold
            75% and Bet 25%&quot;. Are you supposed to roll a die and figure out
            what percentile you currently find yourself?</p>

        <p class="callout">DD Poker has a sophisticated AI engine for <span class="mild">Free</span>!</p>

        <p>It describes the factors that led to its recommendation. It will recommend
            that you might want to attempt to &quot;steal&quot; the blinds or
            simply check for &quot;deception&quot;. It will tell you that a Fold
            recommendation was a combination of hand selection, table position
            and stack size. DD Poker speaks in terms you would learn by reading
            a poker book from a poker expert.</p>

        <p>Finally the company behind this expensive program likes
            to claim it has numerous features that DD Poker doesn't have. Don't
            be fooled. They are talking about the 1st version of DD Poker and not the
            current awesome DD Poker 3.</p>

        <p>Here is a list of features these expensive products
            don't have that you get from DD Poker for <span class="mild">Free</span>:</p>

        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Poker Clock</li>
                <li>Online play on your LAN</li>
                <li>Fill empty seats in an online game with computer players</li>
                <li>Multi table online</li>
                <li> Calculator Tool with flop/turn/river possibilities, hand ladder
                    and hand group simulations
                </li>
                <li>Faster showdown calculator</li>
                <li>Full and complete tournament editor so you can define a tournament
                    to match one you commonly play
                </li>
                <li>Run game in Full Screen mode, or as a resizable window (where
                    the table graphics scale)
                </li>
                <li>Export tournament formats (levels, prizes), analysis stats,
                    leader boards to comma delimited files
                </li>
                <li>And much more. See for yourself by <a href="/download">downloading the game</a>
                    for <span class="mild">Free</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="callout">DD Poker is the best of both worlds. Not only
            is it far less expensive (<span class="mild">did we mention it's Free?</span>),
            but it has more features!</p>
