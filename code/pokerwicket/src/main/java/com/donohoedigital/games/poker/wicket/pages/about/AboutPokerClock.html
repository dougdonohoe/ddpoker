                    <p>Run a mini-tournament during your weekly poker night! </p>

                    <p>DD Poker is a full featured home version of the poker
                        clock software used to run major tournaments like you have seen
                        on TV.</p>

                    <p>To get started, you define the tournament by specifying the buy-in
                        amount, rebuys, add-ons, blind structure, level time limit and
                        payout amounts. You can save tournament formats and re-use them
                        from week to week (no need to re-enter data!)</p>

                    <p>DD Poker makes running a home game mini-tournament
                        easy and fun. In addition, the extensive documentation and FAQ
                        are good tools to resolve rules disputes during the game and keep
                        everyone happy.</p>

                    <p>You can change the tournament settings while it is in progress
                        - in case you need to speed things up.</p>

                    <p>Enter the amount collected during the game and automatically
                        calculate prize payouts.</p></td>

                    <p>The built-in tournament clock (as seen above) has
                        the following features:</p>
