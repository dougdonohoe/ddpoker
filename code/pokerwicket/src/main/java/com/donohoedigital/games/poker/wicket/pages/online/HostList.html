        Below is a list of each host sorted by the number of games they have hosted (in descending order). Use the
        <strong>Start</strong>
        and <strong>End</strong> dates to
        limit the list to a certain date range (e.g., to see who hosted the most games in a particular year or month).
        Use the <strong>Host</strong> field to limit the results to any hosts that match the name. To find an exact
        match, start your entry with an equal sign (e.g., <strong>=nwNut</strong>).
