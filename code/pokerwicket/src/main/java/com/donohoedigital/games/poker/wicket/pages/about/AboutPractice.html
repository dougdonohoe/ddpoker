            <p>Practice playing in limit, pot limit and no limit hold'em tournaments
                like the 2005 World Championship.</p>

            <p>You can select from 15 pre-defined formats and customize them
                to suit your needs or design one from scratch.</p>

            <p>The game's tournament editor allows you to specify the buy-in
                amount, rebuys, add-ons, blinds/ante structure, level time limit
                and payout amounts. DD Poker can match pretty much any tournament
                you play.</p>

            <p>Each tournament is summarized in easy-to-read tabs. You can export
                any table by right clicking on it and saving to a comma delimited
                file, easily readable by spreadsheets like Excel.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Is your goal to play better poker against computer
                    opponents? Probably not. When was the last time you took a monster
                    pot off of a robot? You're probably looking to improve your
                    game against real people. If so, then it's important that you
                    practice against computer players who play realistically. </p>

                <p>Sound poker strategy is an important part of any
                    worthy computer opponent, but the human players in a typical
                    game rarely play that way. If you want to improve your chances
                    in a real tournament, you don't need an opponent that can beat
                    you as much as you need an opponent that can teach you. Rather
                    than opponents who never go on tilt, who never throw their chips
                    at you, and never grow tired or bored of the game, you need
                    opponents who do all of those things, because that's exactly
                    what real people do. Rather than advice on how to play a hand
                    that's based on extensive and complex computations that you
                    can neither fully understand nor perform in your head, you need
                    advice explained in terms of simple concepts that you can apply
                    at the table.</p>

                <p>DD Poker's computer players do just this and more.
                    You control them in terms you understand and they give you advice
                    and the rationale behind it. Rather than simple recommendations
                    like &quot;fold&quot;, &quot;check&quot; or &quot;bet&quot;,
                    DD Poker's advisor will tell you that it took into account table
                    position, the size of the your stack and the relative strength
                    of your hand.</p>

            <p>DD Poker is extremely easy to use and

            <ul>
                <li>Run full screen or in a regular resizable window (good for
                    playing at work). No other poker software on the market lets
                    you resize the window (unbelievable in today's high-tech era!)
                </li>
                <li>Within the window, you can resize the dashboard, chat area
                    and poker table.
                </li>
                <li>You don't need to use the mouse at all during the tournament.
                    Each action is controlled by a key (for example, 'D' starts
                    the deal.
                </li>
                <li>There are no annoying pop-up windows for entering bets (an
                    entry field is right on the main screen which is controlled
                    by &quot;spinner&quot; buttons, a slider, the arrow keys and
                    the mouse wheel).

                        </li>

                            you, it is silly to fold. The game will prevent you from

                            are played in an hour. This is used to control the rate
                            of the tournament clock.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Time Delay</strong> - control the delay between
                            computer player actions. Go slow so you can see the action
                            as it happens or go fast to get in as many hands as you
                            can.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Deck Design</strong> - choose from a variety of
                            deck designs or customize it with your own image.
