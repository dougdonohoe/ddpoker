                <p>Practice playing in limit, pot limit and no limit hold'em tournaments
                    like the 2005 World Championship.</p>

                <p>You can select from 15 pre-defined formats and customize them
                    to suit your needs or design one from scratch.</p>

                <p>The game's tournament editor allows you to specify the buy-in
                    amount, rebuys, add-ons, blinds/ante structure, level time limit
                    and payout amounts. DD Poker can match pretty much any tournament
                    you play.</p>

                <p>Each tournament is summarized in easy-to-read tabs. You can export
                    any table by right-clicking on it and saving to a comma-delimited
                    file, easily readable by spreadsheets like Excel.</p>

                    Intelligence</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Is your goal to play better poker against computer
                        opponents? Probably not. When was the last time you took a monster
                        pot off of a robot? You're probably looking to improve your
                        game against real people. If so, then it's important that you
                        practice against computer players who play realistically. </p>

                    <p>Sound poker strategy is an important part of any
                        worthy computer opponent, but the human players in a typical
                        game rarely play that way. If you want to improve your chances
                        in a real tournament, you don't need an opponent that can beat
                        you as much as you need an opponent that can teach you. Rather
                        than opponents who never go on tilt, who never throw their chips
                        at you, and never grow tired or bored with the game, you need
                        opponents who do all of those things, because that's exactly
                        what real people do. Rather than advice on how to play a hand
                        that's based on extensive and complex computations that you
                        can neither fully understand nor perform in your head, you need
                        advice explained in terms of simple concepts that you can apply
                        at the table.</p>

                    <p>DD Poker's computer players do just this and more.
                        You control them in terms you understand, and they give you advice
                        and the rationale behind it. Rather than simple recommendations
                        like &quot;fold&quot;, &quot;check&quot; or &quot;bet&quot;,
                        DD Poker's advisor will tell you that it took into account table
                        position, the size of your stack and the relative strength
                        of your hand.</p>

                    <li>Run full screen or in a regular resizable window (good for
                        playing at work). No other poker software on the market lets

                    </li>
                    <li>Within the window, you can resize the dashboard, chat area

                    </li>
                    <li>You don't need to use the mouse at all during the tournament.
                        Each action is controlled by a key (for example, 'D' starts
                        the deal.
                    </li>
                    <li>There are no annoying pop-up windows for entering bets (an
                        entry field is right on the main screen which is controlled
                        by &quot;spinner&quot; buttons, a slider, the arrow keys and
                        the mouse wheel).

                                you, it is silly to fold. The game will prevent you from

                                as it happens or go fast to get in as many hands as you
