    // Notes:
    //
    // Load sequence works as such:
    //
    // 1) game main class (subclass of GameEngine typically) calls static LoadSavedGame.loadGame()
    // 2) loadGame() invokes phase InitializeGameLoad which displays a message such as "Loading..." then
    // 3) invokes LoadSavedGame phase
    // 4) this phase (LoadSavedGame) actually reads and creates game (see start())
    // 5) loading of game in Game uses processStartPhase() which invokes the
    //    begin phase returned by the GameStateDelegate, which is assumed to be a 
    //    subclass of chain phase.  Typically the begin phase creates the game board
    //    but can be any chain phase for special cases.
    // 6) After the begin phase runs, it invokes the phase stored in the game
    //    file, using the ChainPhase PARAM_NEXT_PHASE, PARAM_NEXT_PHASE_PARAMS 
    //    invocation (similar to above)
    // 7) At that point the game is loaded and running.
