<p>The Advisor is a computer player that sits over your shoulder, providing advice 
  on how to play your hand and why.&nbsp; The advisor can use the style of play 
  defined by any Player Type, including those of your design.&nbsp; You can even 
  use a Player Type as a starting point and customize it from there.&nbsp; By 
  changing the advisor strategy during the game, you can see how different types 
  of players would handle a given situation.&nbsp; The Advisor can be found in 
  the DD Dashboard during practice games.&nbsp; By default, the Advisor will employ 
  the strategy defined as 'Solid'.&nbsp; The Player Type used by the Advisor can 
  be selected from the context menu that can be accessed by clicking on your cards.&nbsp; 
  Advisor strategy can be further refined from the Advisor Information pop-up 
  screen described below. </p>
<p>See the opponents section in the <a href="options.html">Options</a> help for 
  more information on Player Types.</p>
<strong></strong>
<p>When the Advisor dashboard item is <img src="../images/button-dasharrow-off.png" height="12" width="12">
collapsed, the Advisor will simply display the action it suggests;
Fold, Check, Bet, or Raise. When the dashboard item is <img src="../images/button-dasharrow-on.png" height="12" width="12">
expanded, a more specific indication of the strategic move being
suggested is displayed, along with a range of suggested appropriate bet
amounts, if applicable.&nbsp; In addition, the expanded dashboard item
contains two buttons: </p>
<p>Click the <strong>Details</strong> button to bring up the Advisor
Information pop-up screen. There are two tabs of details, Summary, and
Strategy. See below. </p>

Bet Range</b><br>
</p><p>The advice displayed in the
expanded dashboard Advisor includes a range of suggested bet
amounts.&nbsp; It is appropriate to vary your bet amounts in order to
conceal your strategy;&nbsp; if your attempts to steal the blinds
always involve a small raise and your raises for strength always
involve a large raise, your opponents will quickly learn to call your
small raises with weaker hands, and get out of the way when you bet big.<br>
</p>
<p>Bet sizes are expressed relative to one of several amounts,
depending on the circumstances.<br>&nbsp;
</p>
<table style="width: 100%; text-align: left;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;" nowrap="nowrap" valign="top"><b>Big Blind<br>
      </b> </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Bet range is expressed in
multiples of the big blind.&nbsp; This method of expressing bet size is
used for initial betting before the flop, when the amount of
information you have about your opponents' hands is limited.<br>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;" nowrap="nowrap" valign="top"><b>Pot Size</b><br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Bet range is expressed as a
percentage of the pot size.&nbsp; Pot-relative betting is important in
pot and no limit games because by betting in terms of the pot size, you
can control the odds your opponent has to call, and the pot odds you're
giving yourself, given the chances your opponent will call.&nbsp; This
method of expressing bet size is used primarily after the flop, but
also before the flop late in a tournament when the blinds get large
compared to the average number of chips each player has.<br>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;" nowrap="nowrap" valign="top"><b>Stack Size</b><br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Bet range is expressed as a
percentage of the number of chips in your stack.&nbsp; Stack relative
bets are suggested in rare circumstances where special considerations
apply, such as the need to keep enough chips to make a meaningful bet
in a future round.<br>

you are unable to place a minimum bet or raise, or doing so would
effectively commit all of your chips, your only choice may be to push
all your chips into the pot.&nbsp; The advisor may also suggest that
you go all in with a very strong hand, or as an intimidating bluff.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>

<p>In all cases, the range is also translated for you into a range of actual chip 
  values, and if you press the Do It button, a bet size is randomly selected from 
  within the recommended range. </p><p>
<b>Action</b>
</p><p>In order to improve your play, it is important to understand the
strategic motivation for the advisor's suggestions.&nbsp; For instance,
if the advisor tells you to raise before the flop, it is helpful to
know if this is because the advisor considers your hand to be strong,
or if the advisor just thinks you have a good chance of stealing the
blinds.&nbsp; As a result, the advisor dashboard item, when expanded,
may be more specific than "Fold", "Check", "Bet", or "Raise" when
indicating recommended actions.<br>

</p><p><b>Decision Factors</b></p>
<p>When deciding what to recommend, the advisor considers a number of
possible outcomes, described in the Dashboard Advice section.&nbsp; The
outcomes that were considered are listed in
descending order of "strength", so the final recommendation will be
listed first. Outcome colors indicate relative strength, with bright
green being the strongest, bright red being the weakest.&nbsp; Dim
colors are more neutral in value.<br>
</p>
<p>Factors
that influenced each outcome are also listed in descending order of
"strength", with strong positives being bright green, and strong
negatives being bright red.<br>
</p>
<p>It is not possible to enumerate here all the details of the process
by which these factors are considered and scored. Many are influenced
by past betting activity in the current hand and previous hands, the
position of play style sliders in the advisor's Player Type definition,
and other details of the situation.&nbsp; It is also beyond the scope
of DD Poker to provide in-depth explanations of the reasons that these
factors are important.&nbsp; We leave that to the excellent and
ever-growing body of poker literature.<br>

the advisor's recommendations:<br>

<p>The Strategy tab allows you to alter the current Player Type being
used as the advisor and view the Recommendation Matrix of hands. The
Recommendation Matrix shows you what the advice would be in the current
situation for every hole card combination you
could hold by mousing over each block in the matrix.&nbsp; The matrix
is color coded, so that you can see at a glance the relative strength
of your position, and what types of hand look good to the
advisor.&nbsp; A general rule of thumb is that
green means bet/raise, yellow means check/call, and red means fold,
with the darker colors generally indicating deceptive moves.</p>
<p>Before the flop, any pair, suited, or unsuited hand is equivalent to
every other of the same rank, regardless of suit, so the matrix is
broken into a 13x13 grid, with AA at the upper left, and 22 at the
lower right.&nbsp; Blocks in the upper-right portion of the matrix
represent suited hands, and blocks in the lower-right represent
unsuited hands.<br>
</p>
<p>After
the flop, it starts to matter which particular cards you're holding.
For instance, if there are two hearts on the board and you have top
pair, ace kicker, it makes a difference if your cards are both hearts.
So on the upper right, or suited portion of the matrix, each block is
broken into four squares, one for each suit. On the lower left, or
unsuited portion of the matrix (including the pairs), each block is
broken into sixteen squares, each representing a different combination
of cards. Post-flop matrices are further complicated by black spaces
for suited combinations on the unsuited portion of the matrix, pair
combinations that would mean two of the same card, and hands that would
include a card that's already on the board. <br>

<p align="left">Once a matrix is complete (instantaneous pre-flop), mouse-over 
  will bring up the specific hands represented and the recommended play in the 
  help area. The matrix is useful for seeing that a better kicker or suited cards 
  would improve the value of your hand, for spotting strong hand possibilities 
  you may have missed, and things like that. They're also useful for seeing how 
  the sliders affect AI/Advisor play. They're mainly a rough visualization though; 
  for getting a general sense of how the advisor would play in a situation.</p>
