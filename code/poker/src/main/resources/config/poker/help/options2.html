<p>Player types are nicknames given to the style of play of different
    kinds of players.</p>

<p>When you sit down at a poker table, you will typically find yourself
    surrounded by a variety of different player styles. The location of a
    poker game may change the mix of the type of players you play against.
    For example, a home game may have a higher percentage of weak players,
    or a casino a higher percentage of strong players. We have a different
    mix of player types for the pre-defined tournaments the game shipped
    with. You can change this mix of players by making a copy of a
    tournament definition and then changing the options under the Opponent
    Mix tab of the <a href="settings.html">Edit Tournament</a> window.</p>

<p>We have designed the computer AI with player types that you will
    most likely see and you may also create your own AI player types, with
    their own starting hand selection and strategy adjustments. We recommend a mix of AI player types in your games as
    it will be more difficult to identify individual player types and stratigies. <br>

        This setting adjusts how loose or tight this player is before the flop.
        <p>A loose player plays more hands then the average player and
            inevitably is involved in more pots. They will many times will call the
            starting hands to at least see the flop. A tight player is conservative
            and plays fewer hands then the average player. All players can be
            classified anywhere between Loose and Tight. How tight a player is
            playing should not to be confused with their aggressiveness.</p>

        <p>With sliders in the center at 50, the player plays in exact
            accordance to the active Hand Selection Scheme based on the number of
            players at the table chosen at the top of the Edit Player Type screen.
            As you adjust the slider to the left, the player becomes increasingly
            tight, with more hands being considered weak. When the slider is all
            the way to the left at zero, the active hand selection will be ignored,
            and the player will fold everything but the very strongest hands. As
            you adjust the slider to the right, the player becomes increasingly
            loose, with more hands being considered playable. When the slider is
            all the way to the right at 100, every hand is played like it was
            unbeatable.<br>

<p>The hand selection scheme controls how the AI reacts to their hole
    cards. This tells only a small fraction of the whole story, as it
    doesn't reflect any consideration of the other basic decision-making
    factors, which can very significantly affect the outcome. However, the
    hand selection is a critical starting point in the decision making
    process. The Hand Selection Schemes here are used in the makeup of
    player types in the Hand Selection of the Edit Player Type screen. <br>

                        initial reaction to your hole cards when you first look at them.
                        Obviously if you peek at your cards and find two aces, you're going to
                        feel pretty excited about it, regardless of anything else. If you find
                        seven-deuce off suit, you're going to start waiting for your turn to
                        fold. In between, things vary. If you're heads-up and have ace-nine
                        suited, you're going to be pretty strongly inclined to play the hand.
                        If you're at a full table, a good player will probably expect to fold.
                        It's this basic confidence in your hand that is reflected in a hand
                        selection scheme, and as such hand selection is a major factor in how
                        loose or tight a particular computer player is. <br>

                        <p>The hand selection scheme is used to set base "scores"
                            for each possible outcome, which are then adjusted based on the value
                            of the loose/tight slider, as well as many other factors, like
                            position, etc. As the slider moves from the center, a weighted offset
                            will be applied according to a set of canonical hand strengths for the
                            selected level of tightness. Player types for which the slider is set
                            to its loosest value will play every single hand like aces. With the
                            slider set to its tightest value, a player will be *extremely* tight.
                            At these extremes, the hand selection scheme will be effectively
                            ignored. At the center, the hand selection scheme will be used
                            unmodified. In between is in between. Some schemes will be better
                            suited to full tables, some to short-handed games, and some to games
                            with only two or three players, and each computer player has a
                            particular scheme it uses for each of these three situations.<br>
                        </p>

                        <p>When definining a hand selection scheme, you create a
                            set of hand groups, each of which is rated to indicate a basic measure
                            of its raw strength. This rating is expressed in 'chips', with values
                            ranging in increments of 1/2 chip up to 5 full chips. A rating of 5
                            chips should be assigned to the strongest of hands, starting with
                            pocket aces. The most absurdly tight of schemes might rate only pocket
                            aces a full 5 chips. Looser schemes might include pocket kings, queens,
                            or even jacks, as well as hands like ace-king suited. Hands that are
                            essentially unplayable are not included in any group at all,
                            effectively having a rating of zero chips. These are hands for which
                            you would be unwilling to put money in the pot before the flop except
                            in special circumstances (like for instance good pot odds from an
                            all-in opponent). Hands in the middle should be rated using the
                            Relative Strength chips keeping in mind; the most basic pre-flop
                            strategy of every computer player in a seat not required to post a
                            blind bet.<br>
