<p>DD Poker gives you the ability to analyze how you play. The analysis
    functionality collects statistics independently for each player profile. It
    is therefore a good idea to use different profiles for each person playing so
    that everyone has their own statistical data.</p>

<p> Each and every hand dealt, in every game played by the player, practice and
    online, is saved here and added to the statistical analysis. You can actually
    view the entire hand history (all down cards, board cards, bets, everything)
    of every hand you ever played. The statistics display how you play each hand
    and how often you win or lose with it.</p>

<p> Stats are shown for the current player profile, which can be changed with
    the <strong>Change / Edit Player Profile... </strong>button. <BR>&nbsp;

                with player names or game numbers from real Paradise Poker hands, and to protect your important hand
                history data from any possible corruption by unforseen consequences of importing data from DD Poker.</p>
