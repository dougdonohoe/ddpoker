                            Note: You may verify the tournament structure before clicking <strong>OK</strong>
                            with the <strong>Verify</strong> button. The rules it uses are as
                            follows: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There must always be a small blind and a big blind if a level is defined.</li>
                            <li>Blank levels are eliminated. Example: If you define levels 1, 3 and 4, this will be
                                converted to levels 1, 2 and 3.
                            </li>
                            <li>The ante cannot be larger than the small blind and must be at least 5% of the small
                                blind. This is done to ensure chip color-ups can occur at reasonable times. Example: It
                                doesn't make sense to have a $3 ante with $10,000/$20,000 blinds.
                            </li>
                            <li>The small blind cannot be larger than the big blind.</li>
                            <li> Blinds cannot be less than a prior level</li>
                            <li>Antes can drop to zero, then raise again as long as they are higher then previous
                                antes.
                            </li>
                            <li>Antes and blinds are rounded as follows:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>&nbsp;$1 to $100, rounded to nearest $1</li>

                            <li>Rounding is done to avoid blinds like $34,168 and to ensure chip color-ups can occur at

                        three ways:
                        <p><strong>1. Donohoe Digital Automatic Algorithm - </strong>This algorithm automatically
                            adjusts for changes to the number of players and payout spots. The algorithm is a close
                            approximation to what you might see in major tournaments. It pays increasing multiples of
                            the buy-in (starting at 1.5x and increasing by .5x) to tables outside of the final table.
                            The final table is allocated using the &quot;golden ratio&quot; proportion derived from the
                            Fibonacci sequence.</p>

                        <p><strong>2. Percentage </strong>- With this option, you manually specify the percent of the
                            prize pool each spot gets. The total percentage must equal 100%. This option is good for
                            home tournaments because it is not impacted by a change in the number of players.</p>

                        <p><strong>3. Fixed Amount - </strong>With this option, you specify a fixed dollar amount. The
                            total amount must equal the prize pool. This is a good option for replicating historical
                            tournaments where you know the actual payouts.</p></td>

                            <br>

                            <br>
                            Note: CSV is a standard format that stands for Comma Separated, Values. The entire invite

                            <br>
                            Hint: You can copy the entire invite list from the Text (CSV) tab by highlighting selected
                            text with your mouse and pressing CTRL-C to copy on Windows, or Apple-C on mac. Once in the
                            clipboard, you may paste the list by pressing CTRL-V on Windows, or Apple-V on mac. <br>
                            <br>
                            Hint: The Invite List is specific to only the tournament you are editing and will be
                            permanently saved with that tournament when you edit it before opening the poker lobby. This
