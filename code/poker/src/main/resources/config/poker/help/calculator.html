<!-- Intro and screen shot & showdown header -->
Use the DD Poker Calculator Tool to run in depth hand analysis and calculate showdown
outcomes. The Calculator Tool has many uses:
<ul>
    <li>Calculate full pre-flop showdown odds, like they show on poker TV shows.</li>
    <li>Find out why winner of AK suited versus pocket two's heads-up is essentially
        a coin flip (50/50).
    </li>
    <li>Find out all the ways your hand can improve after the turn and river cards
        come.
    </li>
    <li>Measure how your hand stacks up against all possible opponent's hands.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you use the Calculator Tool from a game, it automatically loads
    the current cards on the table each time you open the window. The exception
    to this is if you change any of the cards or number of opponents to research
    other scenarios. In this case, the Calculator Tool will leave your settings
    as you left them. To reset the tool back to the current hand, click on any card
    and choose the &quot;Load All Cards&quot;.</p>

<p>Hint: You can drag the calculator window outside the DD Poker window so you can keep it open as you play. <br>

This tab calculates the win/lose/tie percentage of each hand against each other
using the defined community cards (blank cards are wild). There are two ways to
calculate this: Running all possible combinations or simulating trials with random
samplings. When in Practice mode, your current hand and the community cards will
automatically appear. Click the Run button to start the calculator. <br>

            <p><strong>What do the number of combinations mean?</strong> Cards that
                are unknown or not visible are called &quot;wild cards&quot;. These could
                be community cards or your opponent's cards. When there is a wild card,
                the calculator will calculate all the possible outcomes and display a
                percentage for each player's chance to win, lose, or tie.</p>

            <p> Note: The Showdown Calculator takes every possible hand combination
                into account when calculating. It does not figure that your opponent would
                have folded a poor hand like a 2 7 off suit, or that they would have more
                likely stayed in with a pair of kings. See the note on &quot;uniform&quot;
                distribution in the Hand Strength section below.</p>

            <p>If there are no wild cards, there is only 1 combination, meaning everyone's
                hand is showing and there is only one possible result.</p>

            <p>If there are multiple wild cards, then DD Poker uses a branch of mathematics
                called combinatorics to determine the number of combinations. We won't
                get into the details of the equation used to determine this, but rest
                assured DD Poker does the hard math for you.</p>

            <p>As you add more wild cards in multiple hands, the number of possible
                combinations grows exponentially. As an extreme example, calculating 10
                hands of wild cards and 5 wild cards on the board would have
                60,281,548,319,469,636,261,129,060,633,600,000
                combinations and take longer than the age of the universe to calculate!
                In cases like that, use the simulate option unless you have a really really
                really large amount of free time on your hands.<br>

Once you specify your hole cards and three of the community cards (i.e., the flop),

Once you specify your hole cards and at least three of the community cards, this
tab shows the odds that your hand, together with the current community cards,
is the best possible hand. Because the odds a particular hand will win diminishes
as you face more opponents, the Hand Strength tab shows the odds versus 1 through
9 opponents. Using this you can see that pocket aces and a board of Kd 5s 10s
wins 96.62% of the time against one opponent (heads-up) and only 87.16% against
4 opponents.
<p>The Hand Strength item in the DD Dash board shows the same value on this tab,
    using the row for the number of opponents still left in the hand. The hand strength
    calculations assume your opponents hands are equally likely to have a poor hand
    as well as a good hand and the percentage is calculated based on all possible
    hands remaining. This is known as a &quot;uniform&quot; distribution. In a future
    version of DD Poker we will allow you to measure your hand strength against
    what your opponents are &quot;likely&quot; to hold.<br>

This tab displays wins, loses, and tie percentages of your hand compared to
the groups of hands defined in &quot;Hand Groups&quot; in <a href="options.html">Options</a>.
<br>
<br>
With one or two board cards defined, this tab shows how your hand does against
random hands and the hands in all defined hand groups (see Hand Groups tab in
<a href="options.html">Options</a>) Because there are millions of possible 5-card
board combinations, it simulates a random subset of them and tally's wins, loses
and ties. </p>
<p>With three, four or five board cards defined, this tab shows how your hand,
    together with the current board cards, does against random hands and the hands
    in all defined hand groups. It then calculates and<span class="style3"> tally's
  wins, loses, and ties</span> based on all <span class="style3"> possible remaining 
  board cards. (practice only) </span></p>
