Many tournaments these days use computer programs to manage the tournament. After
all, there are several things to track: the levels, clock, rebuys, add-ons, and
payouts. DD Poker provides a similar feature to allow you to easily
run a poker tournament at home.
<p>All you have to do is select a pre-defined tournament (or define your own in
    <a href="settings.html"><strong>Edit Tournament</strong></a>) and begin. DD
    Poker counts down the clock for each level and breaks, then notifies
    you audibly and visually when the level is about to end. If there are rebuys
    and/or add-ons, you are reminded when they should occur. As the &quot;bank,&quot;
    you track the buy-ins, rebuys and add-ons: Added together, this is tour prize
    pool. DD Poker provides an easy way to determine the prize payouts.</p>

<p> Tips on running your own home poker tournament can be found in the <a href="hosting.html"><strong>Hosting
    Tips</strong></a> help topic.</p>
