We first recommend reading the <a href="holdem.html">Texas Hold'em</a> help category.
This explains the basic fundamentals of Texas Hold'em poker.
<p>Start with the <strong>Beginner Game</strong> tournament. This tournament is
    a lower stakes game and has a player mix and skill level similar to the opponents
    you would face at a Friday night game at a friend's house.</p>

<p>Use the <a href="gameboard.html">Poker Table</a> help category while you are
    playing the game to understand all the items displayed on the poker table.</p>

<p>Let the <strong>Advisor</strong> guide you by following the advice in the DD
    Dashboard on the left of the poker table. Click the <strong>Details</strong>
    button under Advisor to understand its rationale.</p>

<p>As your skill improves, advance to the <strong>Card Room</strong>, then to
    a <strong>Vegas</strong> tournament, and finally test your skill in the <strong>World
        Championship</strong>!</p>
