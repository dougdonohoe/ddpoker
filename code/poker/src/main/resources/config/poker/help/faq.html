            a lot of useful information.<br> <br>
            If you are still in need of support, visit <a href="https://www.ddpoker.com/support">https://www.ddpoker.com/support</a>
            for instructions on how to obtain support. When asking for support, it is
            very helpful to include the DD Poker log file. This is very simple to do,
            just click the <strong>Support</strong> button from the <a href="mainmenu.html">Main
                Menu</a>, then click the <strong>Copy</strong> button. Then paste it into
            your message.

            forward in intelligence, therefore each AI takes a fraction of a second
            longer to make a decision.

            either host a game to be posted on our public games list where strangers may join, or you wish to join a
            game already listed on our public games list. If you wish to play a private internet game with a friend over
            the internet, have the host cut and paste their Internet Game URL to an email and send it to you. Then just
            simply paste that Game URL in the Join Online screen.

            public games. You do not need to set up your ports or do anything with your router if you only wish to Join
            public games, only if you wish to Host one.

            will need to edit your IP address in your router settings to match the Local IP Address shown at the top of
            your Setup Online Tournament (2 of 2) screen, when you Host Online. If you are using a standard router with
            the default settings, your router may assign a different IP address to your host computer if you reboot or
            lose power, thus needing to reconfigure your port forwarding or virtual server settings. You must also
            configure any security software you are using to allow DD Poker to have full internet and LAN communication,
            and allow it to have full UDP, TCP access and communiation over ports 11885 to 11889.

            DSL modems, routers, and PC software such as Windows Firewall and Norton Internet Security can each have
            their own firewall. So someone could potentially have three firewalls, their DSL modem, router, and software
            firewall. If the <strong>Test Connection</strong> button test failed, a firewall in any of these three areas
            can be blocking incomming connections, and require UDP and TCP ports 11885-11889 to be opened. Note: You may
            still Join online game without setting up any ports, you only need to configure your ports if you wish to
            Host an online game. </p>

        <td valign="top">We use a central server to list public games and post results on our web page. A peer to peer
            network is used for online games. In other words, the host computer handles all communication with all the
            players in the game. This allows games to be played in local area networks such as an office that does not
            allow for outside internet access.

        <td valign="top">It is not as critical as other games with real time action, but it is still a good idea for the
            person hosting an online game to have a fast computer with a stable internet connection.

    <tr>
        <td wdith="150" align="left" valign="top">Can I use dialup to play online?</td>
        <td valign="top">Yes, since the DD Poker does not require much bandwidth,
            dialup can be used. However, if you use too much bandwidth from other internet
            usage, like surfing the web, you may find yourself temporarily disconnected
            from the host of the game.
