                        example of a LAN can be two or more of your home computers all connected
                        with a router. Another example may be an office LAN, depending on
                        your company LAN setup and policies. In either case, each user is
                        required to have their own licensed copy of DD Poker.
</p>
<p>In most cases, other computers on your LAN will automatically find
    the game you are hosting shown under <strong>Games Running On Your
        LAN</strong> when they click the <strong>Join Online</strong> button.
    If their computer can not automatically find the game you started
    due to network issues on your LAN, they may still be able to join.
    You will need to send the entire <strong>Game URL</strong> to these
    people. You may do this by clicking the Copy button which copies
    the Game URL to your clipboard and then pasting it into an email
    or instant message. Another option is to simply yell over the cubicle
    wall the Game URL. These players can either type the Game URL in
    manually or can copy the Game URL and click the <strong>Paste</strong>
    button next to Game URL on their Join Game screen.</p>

<p> If you are behind a firewall, such as a router, your LAN Game
    URL will use the IP address assigned by your router. Note: The game
    can accept connections from both guests using the Game URL on your
    local area network and others using your internet Game URL (see
    below).<br>

                    poker information to the hosting computer. This is done by port forwarding

                    the address entered. It should arrive within seconds, but may take
                    longer based on the email traffic of your internet service provider.
                    If you do not receive the email within a reasonable amount of time,
                    make sure your email provider or your email program is not filtering

<ul>
    <li>If you are the host of a LAN game and your IP address changes, the new IP
        address will be used, and the guests can rejoin by clicking your game in the
        LAN game list. This could happen in an office if you play at lunch and wanted
        to resume the next day but the LAN changed your computer IP overnight. <br>
    </li>
    <li>If you are the host on an internet game, you will not be able to resume
        the tournament if your public IP address changes after a power failure. This
        can happen if you ISP assigns a new IP address when re-establishing an internet
        connection. This can also happen if your router loses power longer then a
        brief interruption. In a future version of DD Poker, we will allow you to
        reconfigure your public internet address while in-game.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Typically, routers try to re-assign the same local IP address to a computer
        when re-connecting, but depending on the router, it may assign a different
        number.
