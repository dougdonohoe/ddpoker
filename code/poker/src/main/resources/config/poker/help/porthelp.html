<p>In order to host an online game, other computers on the Internet need to know
    how to reach you. When you start (host) an online game, you will supply a <strong>Game
        URL</strong> to the others wishing to join your game. This game URL is a single
    line that consists of an IP address, a port number, game ID, and game password.
</p>

<p>An IP address stands for Internet Protocol address. Every computer on the Internet
    is assigned one, typically by your Internet service provider; you can think
    of it like the address on your house. If you don't have a router or firewall,
    the process of hosting a game is pretty straightforward. You simply provide
    your figurative house address, the entire game URL shown on your <strong>Setup
        Online Tournament</strong> menu, to the others wishing to join your game for
    a private game. You can copy this Game URL with the copy button to the right
    of the game URL, and paste it into an email to invite the other players wishing
    to join the game. Alternatively, you may paste the game URL into an instant
    message or simply verbally read the number to someone via telephone. If you
    wish to host or join a public game posted on the public games list, an additional
    step is needed to online-activate your profile to list/join public games. If you do
    not wish to host or join a game posted as a public game, this step is not needed
    for private games between friends. </p>

<p> If you have a firewall, a step may be needed in order to host any online game over the Internet. A firewall
    separates your computer from the outside world to prevent hackers from being able to access your computer, think of
    it as a figurative brick wall between your computer and the Internet. In order for the outside world to access your
    computer to do things such as receiving email or downloading things from the Internet, <strong>ports</strong> are
    used. A port can be thought of as removing a brick from your brick wall to allow incoming information to pass
    through. Specific ports are pre-reserved for things like the Internet and email. Online games must use their own
    port, removing their own brick from the wall in order to host online games. DD Poker uses TCP and UDP port numbers
    11885-11889.</p>

<p>If you are using an internet security or firewall program, you will need to allow &quot;ddpoker&quot; access to the
    internet, or configure ddpoker access through TCP and UDP port numbers 11885-11889. Although your setup and version
    may differ, here are some guidelines for some specific programs. Windows SP2 Firewall needs to Unblock the program
    ddpoker. Norton Internet Security needs to add a modify rule to permit TCP and UDP over remote port 11885. If using
    the Mac firewall, add a new incoming network communication to allow DD Poker add the ports. If using the Zone Alarm,
    allow all internet and server access to ddpoker.exe. </p>

<p>If you have a router, you will need to &quot;port forward&quot; or set up a
    &quot;virtual server&quot;. A router allows several computers in your home to
    share your connection to the Internet, it also supports its own built-in firewall.&nbsp;
    Your router keeps the IP address assigned by your Internet service provider
    as its own. The router then assigns local IP addresses to each computer in your
    home or LAN (local area network). This internal IP address can not be seen by
    the outside world. So in order for the computer hosting your poker game to receive
    incoming game information from the Internet, your router uses <strong>Port Forwarding</strong>.&nbsp;
    This allows game information sent to your router from the other player's computer
    to communicate with the computer hosting the game behind your router. The router
    must be setup to do this, by being told to forward anything entering TCP and UDP port numbers 11885-11889
    to the local IP address of the computer that is hosting the poker game.</p>

<p>Some DSL modems have their own built in firewalls. So someone could potentially have three firewalls, their DSL
    modem, router, and software firewall. If the <strong>Test Connection</strong> button test failed, a firewall in any
    of these three areas can be blocking incomming connections, and require TCP and UDP port numbers 11885-11889 to be
    opened. Note: You may still Join online games without setting up any ports, you only need to configure your ports if
    you wish to Host an online game. </p>

<p>Specific examples to configure your firewall's, internet security, and routers
    can be found on our website at: <a href="https://www.ddpoker.com/onlinesupplement">https://www.ddpoker.com/onlinesupplement</a><br>

<p> There are many router companies, each having different ways of setting up Port Forwarding, please refer to your
    router manual for specific instructions on how to access your router setup and port forward. Below is the typical
    information that is needed to set up Port Forwarding once you have accessed your router setup.</p>

<p>Although some router setups are accessed with software, most can be accessed using your web browser by typing in your
    routers address in the web address field of your browser. Each router is different and you will need to look up
    your's in your router manual. Belkin for example uses http://192.168.2.1 </p>

<p> Enter <strong>DDPoker</strong> for the Service Name. The Service name may also be called Application Name,
    Description or Virtual Server Name.</p>

<p> DD Poker uses<strong>TCP and UDP port numbers 11885-11889. </strong>Enter <strong>11885 to 11889 </strong> in all
    the places where the router asks for any and all of the following: Starting Port, Ending Port, Incoming Port,
    Inbound Port, Public Port, Private Port, Forwarding Port. Do not use port <em>triggering</em>, that will not help.
</p>

<p> Enter the Local IP address displayed on your Setup Online Tournament (2 of
    2) page under Host Online where the router asks for an IP address, server IP
    address, private IP address, or forwarding IP address. Your IP address will
    be the IP address of the computer you are going to use as the host computer
    for your poker tournament. It will be in the form of <TT>XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX</TT>
    which is four sets of 1 to 3 digits separated by a periods. An example may be
    192.168.2.2 Note: If you reboot your host computer, your IP address may have
    changed and you may need to re-enter your Port Forwarding IP address in your
    router. You can confirm your ports are still set up properly by clicking the
    Test Connection button.</p>

<p> Enter <strong>TCP</strong> for the service type, also called protocol, type
    or incoming protocol. DD Poker does not use UDP for hosting online games, so
    you do not have to configure that.</p>

            number and game password tacked on. The entire URL needs to be used in order
            to host or join games. You may notice when hosting, there are two different
            types of URL's, one generated by your local area network, and one for the
            internet. If your computer is connected directly to the internet, these
            numbers will be the same. It uses the IP address of your computer, most
            likely assigned by your internet service provider. In the case of a home
            router, your LAN URL and internet URL will be slightly different, the IP
            address is a different number. The internet URL will be the same as described
            above. This is the Game URL you would give your friends if you wish to play
            with them over the internet. The LAN Game URL uses the IP address assigned
            by your router and can only be used by computers in your local area network.
            This is good if you have computers on your LAN you wish to play with, but
            they don't have internet access or the player profiles has not been online-activated
            to join public games. In the case of a business LAN, it is possible that
            no one will have an internet public Game URL, and are forced to use the
            LAN URL.
