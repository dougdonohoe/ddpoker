              When the mouse pointer is placed over any player at the table, the Player Style dash header displays that player's name and displays a graph of their tightness and aggressiveness when maximized.<br>
              <br>
All players can be categorized in two ways. How few or how many hands they play determines how tight/loose they are. How little or how much a player bets determines how passive/aggressive they are.<br>
<br>
The graph is divided into four quadrants. The X axis ranges from <strong>Tight</strong> on the left to <strong>Loose</strong> on the right. The Y axis ranges from <strong>Passive</strong> on the top to <strong>Aggressive</strong> on the bottom. The closer the plotted point is to the edge of the graph, the more that player reflects that attribute.<br>
<br>
Example: A good solid poker player would be tight-aggressive and the point on the graph will be in the bottom left quadrant. Whereas poor poker player typically know as fish would be loose-passive and the point on the graph will be in the upper right quadrant. Several hands of data must be collected on a player before an average is shown. Otherwise &quot;Don't Know Yet&quot; will be displayed. <br>

              a bet or raise. You have several options to change the bet/raise, 
              the easiest is moving the slider with your mouse. You can also use 
              the +/- buttons or <strong>Arrow Keys</strong> to increase/decrease 
              the bet by the amount of the smallest chip denomination (represented 
              by the chip icon above the spinner). If you use the <strong>CTRL-Arrow 
              Keys</strong>, the amount is increased/decreased by 10 times the 
              smallest chip denomination. Pressing the <strong>Enter</strong> 
              key perform the bet/raise with the current amount in the spinner 
              field. 
              <p>The mouse wheel also alters the Amount Spinner by increments 
                of the smallest chip denomination. By holding the <b>CTRL</b> 
                <b>Key</b>, the mouse wheel alters the Amount Spinner by 10X increments 
                of the smallest chip denomination.</p>
              <p> Note: When entering a raise, the number specified is in addition 
                to the amount needed to call (in other words, it is the amount 
                of the raise, not the amount of the total bet). The amount text 
                field will enforce the minimum bet or minimum raise. If you have 
                more chips than everyone else still in the hand, it will enforce 
                a maximum amount (basically the amount required to put any opponent

                symbol is used when the <strong>Pause When All-in</strong> option 
                is turned on. It displays the current hand the player has and 
                the odds that it will end up being the winner at the end of the 
                hand. </p>
              <p><strong>Note</strong>: the odds displayed before the flop are 
                an approximation based on all possible flops (the first 3 cards). 
                We do this because for the typical heads-up all-in hand, determining 
                the precise odds requires calculating all possible five card boards 
                (a total of 1,712,304 combinations!). This takes 9-18 seconds 
                to calculate (depending on your CPU) which is too much of a delay. 
                Thus pre-flop odds are displayed with a tilde (~), indicating 
                &quot;approximate&quot;. Odds displayed after the flop are the 
                precise odds that hand will end up winning.</p>
              <p><strong>Note</strong>: If you wish to determine the true pre-flop 
                odds, use the Calculator Tool's Showdown calculator.</p></td>
