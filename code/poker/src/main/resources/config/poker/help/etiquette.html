            What does this mean? This is an extremely unique situation where Donohoe Digital does not host any of the
            online games. Other customers like yourselves host games. Each public game you see is a welcome by that host
            into their game, unless it is by invite only. It is their party and they choose the ground rules of the
            game. So please respect their ground rules. If you disagree with them, you may join another or host your own
            game.

            lobby.

        <td><strong>All-In Bet -</strong> Making an All-In bet is a powerful tool in No-Limit Texas Hold'em. Since DD
            Poker is a &quot;play money&quot; game, this tool is sometimes abused in a game. New players may not
            understand you may win some random pots by doing this in the short run, but will eventually be busted out,
            and only serves to disrupt the other players. So be aware excessive All-In bets, especially the first half
            of a tournament is frowned upon and you may find yourself not being invited to some public games. Learn to
            use this tool wisely.
