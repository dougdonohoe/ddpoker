    <td align="center" valign="top"><strong>Pot Odds</strong></td>
    <td>The amount of money in the pot versus the amount of money it will cost

        it is for you to call even with mediocre hands because your potential gain is much higher then your call.
        <p>It is often valuable to evaluate the amount in the pot when deciding
            whether or not to call a bet. In a game with a large amount in the pot,
            even a mediocre hand with a small chance of improvement may be worthwhile
            to call. If the pot is small, even a fairly good hand may not be worth
            a call because the amount of risk (the bet) is too large relative to the
            potential gain (the pot).</p>

        <p> If there is a bet that you may call, the pot odds are displayed both
            as odds (N to 1) and a percentage. One concept in poker is that it is
            sometimes appropriate to stay in the hand (hoping for a better hand) if
            the total odds of improvement (as a percentage) are greater than the pot
            odds (as a percentage). Thus if your total odds of improvement total 30%
            and the pot odds show as 20%, it might make sense to call. Over the long
            term, you are expected to win more money than you lose. Another way of putting it, you want enough money in
            the pot to justify calling to see another card.</p>
