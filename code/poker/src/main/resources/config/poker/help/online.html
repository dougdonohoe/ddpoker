DD Poker allows you to enjoy you the fun of playing play-money poker
online (over a local area network (LAN) or the internet), without having to join
an online poker room. You can create a private party and play with one friend
and fill the remainder of the table with computer players, or have all your friends
join for a game. If you wish, you can list your game as public and others from
around the world can join you.<br>
