									antes/blinds, when the smallest chip on the table can be colored-up \
									to the next highest chip.  You may wish to turn this off if you are using non-standard chip \
									denominations (DD Poker uses $1, $5, $25, $100, $500, $1000, etc.) or you don't wish to \
									color-up.

option.onlineaudio.label=			Play Sound When Your Turn To Act

									is helpful if you are multitasking and DD Poker is obscured or minimized.

option.onlinepause.label=			Pause Tournament At Start (host)
option.onlinepause.default=			false
option.onlinepause.help=			If this option is on, when you begin an online tournament, it will automatically be \
									paused at the start.  This allows time for all players to view their table and get \
									ready before cards are dealt.

option.onlinepauseall.label=		Auto Pause Tournament If All Players Disconnected (host)
option.onlinepauseall.default=		true
option.onlinepauseall.help=			If this option is on, the tournament will automatically be paused if all players \
									become disconnected.  This is typically a sign that the host has lost internet \
									connectivity.  The game will be unpaused when at least one player is reconnected.

option.onlineudp.label=				Use UDP When Hosting (beta testing)
option.onlineudp.default=			false
option.onlineudp.help=				If this option is on, the game will use UDP for communication between host and \
									guests.  We are beta testing this feature as a possible replacement to the \
									default method of TCP/IP.

option.countdown.label=				Display Countdown Timer Bar When Your Turn To Act
option.countdown.default=			true
option.countdown.help=				With this option on, a thin color bar is displayed just below the poker table \
									when it is your turn to act.  It displays the amount of time left to act.  The green \
									portion represents the standard game player action timeout.  The yellow portion \
									represent the amount of think bank time you have left.

option.clockpause.label=			Pause Clock At End Of Each Level
option.clockpause.default=			false
option.clockpause.help=				With this option on, the Poker Clock will automatically pause at the end of each level. \

option.autocheckupdate.default=		true
option.autocheckupdate.help=		If this option is on, an update check will be performed when you start DD Poker.  If an update \
is available, a message will be displayed with the details.

option.rightclickonly.label=		Right Click Only Pop-up Menus
option.rightclickonly.default=		false
option.rightclickonly.help=			By default, the pop-up menus in the poker table are triggered by either left or right \
									mouse clicks.  However, power users may wish to turn off the left-mouse trigger, which is \
									a non-standard user interface convention.  Turn on this option to turn off left-click pop-up menu triggering.

option.autodeal.label=				Auto Deal
option.autodeal.default=			false
option.autodeal.help=				Automatically deal the next hand at the end of the current hand, after a brief delay (specified in the Time Delay section).

option.autosave.label=				Auto Save
option.autosave.default=			false
option.autosave.help=				After you have saved a tournament (or resumed a saved tournament) and this option is on, then \
									the tournament will automatically be saved at the end of each hand.

option.holecarddown.label=         Hole Cards Face Down
option.holecarddown.default=       false
option.holecarddown.help=          Normally your hole cards are dealt face up and are always visible.  If this option is on, then \
                                   your hole cards are face down and you need to pass the mouse over them to view them.  This is \
                                   good practice for real poker games where you need to be able to quickly memorize your cards!

option.pauseallin.label=        Pause When All-in
option.pauseallin.default=      true 
option.pauseallin.help=         If this option is on, the action pauses \
								when you and any remaining players are all-in.  The type of hand and odds of it \
								winning is displayed.  You must click the Continue button (or C key) to show \
								the flop, turn and river cards.  If this is off, the community cards are displayed automatically.

option.pausecolor.label=        Pause During Color-up
option.pausecolor.default=      true 
option.pausecolor.help=         If this option is on, the action pauses \
								  when the color-up chip race occurs after the cards are dealt \
								  and after the chips are awarded to the high cards.  You must click the Continue \
								  button (or C key) to see the next step.  If this is off, the color-up happens automatically \
								  with a slight pause after each step.

option.zipmode.label=                Jump To End After Fold
option.zipmode.default=         false
option.zipmode.help=            Normally, after you fold you have to watch the other players finish out the hand (just like in a real tournament). \
							   With this option on, you automatically jump to the end of the hand after you fold.

option.showdown.label=          Show Winning Hand
option.showdown.default=        false
option.showdown.help=           In a typical game, if a player wins because all other players fold, they \
                                do not have to show their hand.  With this option, the winning hand \
                                is displayed face up at the end of the hand.

option.showmuck.label=          Show Mucked Hands
option.showmuck.default=        false
option.showmuck.help=           In a typical game, if a player has a losing hand and acts after the winner during showdown, they \
                                do not have to show their hand (they can 'muck', or throw them away).  With this option, any mucked hands \
                                are displayed face up at the end of the hand.

option.mouseover.label=         Peek At Opponent's Cards
option.mouseover.default=       false
option.mouseover.help=          In a real game you never know what your opponent is holding - that is the \
                                crux of the game.  However, with this option on, you can view your opponent's \
                                hand by passing the mouse over their cards.  We provide this as a way to \
                                learn from the computer players.  Use it wisely!

option.popups.label=			Show Cheat Popups
option.popups.default=			true
option.popups.help=				When you click on an opponent or any cards on the table, various cheat \
								actions are displayed in a pop-up menu (such as Change Card, Set Player Type, \
								Change Chip Count and Move Button).  If you don't want to be tempted \
								by those actions, uncheck this option.

option.aifaceup.label=			Computer Cards Face Up
option.aifaceup.default=		false
option.aifaceup.help=			If the "Peek" option isn't enough, you can simply deal all the computer player's \
								cards face up as well.  Another way to learn from the computer players.

option.neverbroke.label=        Never Go Broke 
option.neverbroke.default=      false
option.neverbroke.help=         If this option is on, and you lose all of your chips, you automatically get one half of the \
								chips of the tournament leader.  This "transfer" occurs after the \
								next deal is started (so don't forget to click Deal after you bust out). \
								Of course this never happens in the real world, \
								but it can make for some good fun - especially if you go all-in every hand!

option.manualbutton.label=		Don't Move Dealer Button
option.manualbutton.default=	false
option.manualbutton.help=		If this option is on, the dealer button will not be moved between \
								hands.  This is useful if you want to place the dealer button \
								(using the pop-up menus) and play several hands \
								in a row from the same seat position.

option.pausecards.label=		Pause After Cards Dealt
option.pausecards.default=		false
option.pausecards.help=			If this option is on, the action is paused after the hole, flop, turn and \
								river cards are dealt.  This is useful if you want to change any of the \
								cards before any players act (using the pop-up menus).


option.showfold.label=         Show Folded Hands
option.showfold.default=       false
option.showfold.help=          In a real game you typically never see a folded hand.  However, with this option on, \
                               at the showdown you will see your hand (if folded) and the hands of opponents who called, \
							   bet or raised and ultimately folded (you \
                               will not see hands of opponents who folded before the flop without calling the big blind).

option.checkfold.label=          Always Allow Fold
option.checkfold.default=        false
option.checkfold.help=           You never want to fold a poker hand when you have the option of checking. \
							     Normally, the game prevents you from making this mistake. \
								 However, if this option is on, you can fold whenever you wish, \
								 even if a check would suffice.  You may also press the F key at any time to \
								 fold (even before it is your turn to act - this is a way to play even faster!)

option.largecards.label=          Show Large Cards
option.largecards.default=        true
option.largecards.help=           If this option is on, the cards are shown with an exaggerated upper-left corner that is easier to \
                                  read.  If this option is off, the cards are shown like standard playing cards, which may be harder \
                                  to make out on smaller monitors or smaller DD Poker window sizes.

option.fourcolordeck.label=       Use Four-Color Deck
option.fourcolordeck.default=     false
option.fourcolordeck.help=        If this option is on, a four-color deck is used, with clubs in green and diamonds in blue.  This makes \
                                  it easier to spot flush possibilities at a glance, preventing the costly mistake of misreading your hand \
                                  or failing to recognize another player may have drawn out on you.

option.stylized.label=       	  Use Stylized Face Cards
option.stylized.default=     	  true
option.stylized.help=        	  Tired of the same old face cards?  Turn this option on to display DD Poker's stylized take \
								  on face cards, where we show only the crowns for the King, Queen and Jack.

option.disableshortcuts.label=   Disable Keyboard Shortcuts
option.disableshortcuts.default= false
option.disableshortcuts.help=    If this option is on, the keyboard shortcuts D F C B R A E and P, (otherwise known as 'Hot-Keys') are disabled \
                                  for Deal, Fold, Check, Call, Bet, Raise, All-in, rEbuy, and bet Pot. This is an added measure to help prevent \
                                  accidental player actions when typing chat messages online.

option.river.label=             Show All Community Cards
option.river.default=           false
option.river.help=              In a typical game, if a player wins because all other players fold, any \
                                remaining community cards are not dealt.  With this option, these cards are \
                                displayed so the curious can see what those cards would have been - not that it matters! \
				Note:  This practice is known as "rabbit hunting" and is typically prohibited.	

option.handsperhour.label=        Hands per Hour
option.handsperhour.default=      30
option.handsperhour.help=         The numbers of hands per hour controls how fast each level progresses.  For example, \
                                  at 30 hands per hour, every 30 hands played equals an hour of elapsed tournament time. \
                                    Thus, if you are playing a tournament with 30 minute levels, the level will advance \
                                    every 15 hands.  Increase this value to increase the number of hands played per level (and vice versa).

option.delay.label=        Computer Player Pause (10ths seconds)
option.delay.default=      8
option.delay.help=         Amount of time to delay between computer player actions and after community cards are \
						   dealt, in 10ths of seconds.  The range of delay is 0 to 40 (0 to 4 seconds).  Use this to \
						   control the pace of the action.

option.autodealhand.label=     	Auto Deal Pause After Hand (10ths seconds)
option.autodealhand.default=   	30
option.autodealhand.help=      	When Auto Deal is on, amount of time to delay before the next hand starts \
						   	   	after a hand ends, in 10ths of seconds.  The range of delay is 0 to 100 (0 to 10 seconds).

option.autodealfold.label= 		Auto Deal Pause After Fold (10ths seconds)
option.autodealfold.default=	10
option.autodealfold.help=   	When Auto Deal is on, amount of time to delay before the next hand starts \
						    	after you fold, in 10ths of seconds.  The range of delay is 0 to 100 (0 to 10 seconds).

option.autodealonline.label= 	Auto Deal Pause Online (10ths seconds)
option.autodealonline.default=	40
option.autodealonline.help=   	During online games, auto deal is automatically on.  This option specifies the amount of time to delay \
								between hands, in 10ths of seconds.  The range of delay is 0 to 100 (0 to 10 seconds).

option.onlinestart.label= 		Host Start Countdown (seconds)
option.onlinestart.default=		10
option.onlinestart.help=   		Number of seconds to countdown after the host presses the Start button in the lobby \
								before an online tournament starts.  The range of delay is 1 to 25 seconds.

option.screenshotmaxw.label=        Max Width (pixels)
option.screenshotmaxw.default=      1024
option.screenshotmaxw.help=         When taking a screenshot, the image is scaled down so as not exceed this width.

option.screenshotmaxh.label=        Max Height (pixels)
option.screenshotmaxh.default=      768
option.screenshotmaxh.help=         When taking a screenshot, the image is scaled down so as not to exceed this height.

option.onlineenabled.label=	  Enabled
option.onlineenabled.default= false
